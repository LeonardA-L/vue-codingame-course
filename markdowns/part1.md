# This is a hands-on course
Although this vue.js project has a multiple source files I chose to reduce the noise (like the CSS) and only expose the interesting files to the learner (the JS/HTML files).

The learner can modify these files and then run the project in our environnement.

@[Proof of concept Vue]({"stubs": ["index.html", "main.js"], "command": "/bin/bash /project/target/run.sh"})

# With Markdown content
The text around the code area is here to display the actual course content. It's markdown based, and the contributor can explain basically anything and ask the learner to code stuff in the code area.

For this example course, the provided sources make a simple Markdown editor, but the goal for a normal tutorial would be to provide a basis for the learner and instructions on how to code the rest, and the end result would be a complete editor.

This course only has one lesson, but we do support making multiple lessons into one course.

This course is based on [this official example](https://vuejs.org/v2/examples/)
